== Summary

This section will demonstrate how to scale throughput in provisioned throughput mode of an EFS file system.


== Duration

NOTE: It will take approximately 5 minutes to complete this section.


== Step-by-step Guide

=== Generate throughput using dd

IMPORTANT: Read through all steps below and watch the quick video before continuing.

. Return to the browser-based SSH connection of the *EFS Workshop Linux Instance 2* - m5n.2xlarge instance.
+
TIP: If the SSH connection has timed out, e.g. the session is unresponsive, close the browser-based SSH connection window and create a new one. Return to the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/[Amazon EC2] console. *_Click_* the radio button next to the instance with the name *EFS Workshop Linux Instance 2*. *_Click_* the *Connect* button. *_Click_* the radio button next to  *EC2 Instance Connect (browser-based SSH connection)*.Leave the default user name as *ec2-user* and *_click_* *Connect*.
+
. Determine how much throughput an m5n.2xlarge instance can achieve writing to an EFS file system. *_Run_* the following script in the same browser-based SSH connection window. The last commands run nload, a real-time network monitoring tool to see incoming and outgoing network traffic.
+
[source,bash]
----
time dd if=/dev/zero of=/efs/dd/40G-dd-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S.%3N) bs=1M count=40960 conv=fsync &
nload -u M
----
+
. While the above script is running in the browser-based SSH connection window, return to the Amazon EC2 console *_click_* *Services* in the top right are of the window.
. *_Context-click(right-click)_* *EFS* which is under the *Storage* section and *_click_* *Open link in new tab*.
. *_Click_* the new tab that was just opened to go to the *Amazon EFS console*.
. *_Select_* the radio button next to the only EFS file system.
. *_Click_* *Actions* >> *Managed throughput mode*
. From the *Manage throughput mode* window, *_click_* the radio button next to *Provisioned* and *_enter_* *50* in the *Throughput (MiB/s)* text field. *_Click_* save.
. Return to the browser-based SSH connection of the *EFS Workshop Linux Instance 2* - m5n.2xlarge instance.
. Monitor the outgoing network traffic (throughput) to the EFS file system.
. How long does it take for the outgoing network traffic (throughput) to the EFS file system to drop to 50 MB/s?
. Return the previous steps and change the provisioned throughput from 50 MiB/s to 400 MiB/s.
. How long does it take for the outgoing network traffic (throughput) to the EFS file system to change?

NOTE: With provisioned throughput mode you can provision the desired throughput independent of the amount of data stored in the file system. Throughput modes can be changed (bursting to provisioned or provisioned to bursting) as long as it has been more than 24 hours since the last throughput mode change. When in provisioned throughput mode, the amount of throughput provisioned can decreased as long as it has been more than 24 hours since the last throughput decrease or the last throughput mode change. The amount of throughput provisioned can be increased at anytime.

. Once outgoing network traffic drops to zero, the dd command has finished and you can stop *nload* by pressing *control+Z*.
