== Summary

This section will demonstrate how increasing the number of threads accessing an EFS file system will significantly improve throughput.

== Duration

NOTE: It will take approximately 15 minutes to complete this section.


== Step-by-step Guide

=== Different levels of parallelism

IMPORTANT: Read through all steps below and watch the quick video before continuing.

. Return to the browser-based SSH connection of the *EFS Workshop Linux Instance 2* - m5n.2xlarge instance.
+
TIP: If the SSH connection has timed out, e.g. the session is unresponsive, close the browser-based SSH connection window and create a new one. Return to the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/[Amazon EC2] console. *_Click_* the radio button next to the instance with the name *EFS Workshop Linux Instance 0*. *_Click_* the *Connect* button. *_Click_* the radio button next to  *EC2 Instance Connect (browser-based SSH connection)*.Leave the default user name as *ec2-user* and *_click_* *Connect*.

. *_Run_* the following IOR command to generate one 2 GiB file using one thread on an EFS file system. IOR is a commonly used file system benchmarking application typically used to evaluate the performance of distributed and parallel file systems. You can read more about IOR here - link:http://wiki.lustre.org/IOR[http://wiki.lustre.org/IOR].

. Compare the results from the tests above.  Is there a big difference? Why?

* The following table and graphs show the sample results of these tests. Look how increasing the size of the IO (reducing sync operations) and increasing the number of threads (increasing parallelism) impacts the throughput and duration.
